ruby OFF rails
==============
This showcase has 4 components:
1. Some rack middleware
  (1) nothing.ru, a rack middleware do nothing
  (2) calc_time.ru, add response time to HTTP body
  (3) method_override.ru, alter HTTP method

  Before running, run "gem install rack" to install rack.
  Run "rackup nothing.ru"
  See http://localhost:9292 for result.
  Replace nothing.ru with other two file name and navigate the same URL.
2. infinity.rb, a simple sinatra program can process 3 URL
   Before running, run "gem install sinatra" to install sinatra
   Run "ruby infinity.rb"
   See http://localhost:4567 , http://localhost:4567/version
            and http://localhost:4567/version/last for result.
  
3. A sinatra+sequel program, a Create-Update-Read application.
   Before running, run "gem install sequel sqlite3-ruby" to install sequel and sqlite3 database driver.
   Run "ruby notes.rb".
   See http://localhost:4567/notes for result.
4. A sinatra+rails application, show speed difference of Rails MVC, Rails Metal and sintra.
   Before running, run "gem install thin" to install thin, 
     "gem install rails --source http://gems.rubyonrails.org" to install Rails 2.3.
   Run "thin start" to start rails and "thin -R app/metal/hello.rb" to start sinatra standalone.
   See http://localhost:3000/hello/sinatra for traditional rails response;
       http://localhost:3000/sinatra for sinatra running under rails metal or standalone.

   My benchmark result is: sinatra running standalone is 3 times of it running under rails metal.
